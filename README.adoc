= Pitoco

Create API schemas from

We use https://github.com/stathissideris/spec-provider to infer
Malli (https://github.com/metosin/malli) schemas and
https://github.com/wilkerlucio/pathom3 as our main API.

Malli has a way to generate schemas, but it was https://github.com/metosin/malli/issues/191[too slow] in comparison
with `spec-provider`.

See a quick video at https://youtu.be/iMcUTygFrfk.

== Installation

Use it directly from github for now (`lein` and `deps` should be able
to do it).

== Usage

See the test file and rich comments (`comment`) for usage.

We have a web app which uses Pitoco so you can visualize your
schemas easily, but you can use Pitoco as a library.

You can start the server at http://localhost:8081 by loading the
`pitoco.server` namespace. Now access http://localhost:8000.
